\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation} 
The main objective is to create a tool through which the average person can get useful
information about the legal case they present. This includes where to go, who to talk,
and more.   % Uncomment if you want to add another subsection
The consultorio jur√≠dico de la Universidad de los Andes has been working with 
legal cases related to women in general. These cases have been anonymized, organized 
by distinct nature and enriched by legal proffesionals. This could be a promising starting point, as it narrows the problem
down to a specific set of cases. If successful, we could include more data from more diverse
cases knowing our approach is ideal.
