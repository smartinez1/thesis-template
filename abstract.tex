\chapter{Abstract}
The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and the legal field has gained 
increasing attention in recent years, especially with the advent of advanced 
technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs).
These models hold the potential to revolutionize legal systems worldwide by 
enhancing access to legal information and simplifying complex legal jargon for non-experts.
In Colombia, where legal processes are often opaque and inaccessible to the general public, 
AI-driven tools offer promising solutions to improve legal literacy and access to justice. 
This section explores recent advancements in AI applications in the legal domain, 
focusing on the potential of LLMs, legal chatbots, obligation mining, and retrieval-augmented 
reasoning to make legal systems more comprehensible to the average person.
